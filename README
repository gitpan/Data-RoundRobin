DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a round roubin object implementation. It is similar
    to an iterator, only the internal counter is reset to the begining
    whenever it reaches the end. It might also be considered as a circular
    iterator.

INSTALLATION

    The way to install this module is just like all other CPAN modules:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    sudo make install
